00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.150
In the mid-1950s, exports to America increased significantly.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.230
This also applied to the field of plants and flower bulbs.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.090
With this increase in exports, the requirements became stricter.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.240
Especially in terms of phytosanitary measures, plant health.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.140
Phytosanitary measures involve agricultural products exported to countries like America or China,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.060
which need to meet certain requirements.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.260
This is achieved by first subjecting the plants to a pre-soaking installation,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.230
followed by passing them through a rinsing machine.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.220
This way, almost all products can be made export-clean.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.210
This ensures compliance with stringent phytosanitary requirements.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.060
Additionally, the products can undergo a hot water treatment,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.270
and be dried or disinfected.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.210
Treating products can range from flower bulbs to perennials,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.080
and from shrubs to bushes.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.020
When exporting, storing, or cultivating flower bulbs,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.070
rinsing and hot water treatment are essential.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.040
But what exactly happens?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.210
Well, the products arrive and are first pre-soaked,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.150
then they pass through a rinsing machine with a lot of water,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.240
getting sprayed from all sides.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.210
Afterward, they can be disinfected, dried, or receive a hot water treatment if necessary.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.020
A hot water treatment is a process that kills harmful organisms.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.010
By immersing the product in a bath at various temperatures and durations,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.040
the harmful organisms can be eliminated.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.210
This treatment is crucial for exports to America and Japan.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.200
Then they also receive a certification.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.100
My tip for an entrepreneur is:

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.210
'Take good care of your product, cleanliness is better.'
